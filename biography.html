            <h2 class="section-title">Early Life & Introduction to Skateboarding</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Danny Way was born on April 15, 1974, in Portland, Oregon, before his family relocated to San Diego, California, where he would grow up immersed in the vibrant skateboarding culture of Southern California. Growing up near the legendary Del Mar Skate Ranch, young Danny was captivated by the sight of skateboarders performing aerial tricks and pushing the boundaries of what was possible on four wheels.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    His stepfather recognized Danny's enthusiasm for skateboarding and began taking him to the skatepark at a young age. By the age of five, Danny was already immersed in the skateboarding scene, developing skills and fearlessness that would become his trademark. The supportive environment and access to world-class skateparks allowed him to progress rapidly.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    By age six, Danny was already showcasing advanced tricks at local skateparks, turning heads with his natural talent and fearless approach. At just eleven years old, he clinched victory in his first competition, signaling the start of what would become one of skateboarding's most illustrious careers. His early exposure to skateboarding legends at Del Mar shaped his vision of what was possible in the sport.

        <!-- Professional Career -->

            <h2 class="section-title">Professional Career</h2>
            
            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Breaking Into the Pro Ranks (Late 1980s)</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Danny Way turned professional in 1989 at a remarkably young age, joining the ranks of elite skateboarders who would define the sport's evolution through the 1990s and beyond. His progression was meteoric, and his willingness to attempt tricks that seemed impossible set him apart from his peers.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">H-Street and Early Sponsorships</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    In his early professional years, Danny rode for H-Street Skateboards and quickly became known for his innovative approach and technical prowess. He was part of a generation that was pushing street skating to new levels while also maintaining skills in vert and ramp skating—a versatility that would serve him well throughout his career.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Plan B Era (1991-1997)</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    In 1991, at just 17 years old, Danny joined Plan B Skateboards, a company founded by his mentor, Mike Ternasky. This period became one of the most productive and creative phases of his career. Under Ternasky's guidance, Danny invented several tricks that remain challenging for skateboarders today. The Plan B team videos showcased Danny's progression and helped establish him as one of skateboarding's most progressive riders.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    The tragic death of Mike Ternasky in 1994 was a devastating blow to Danny and the entire skateboarding community. Despite this loss, Danny continued to push forward, eventually becoming a co-owner of Plan B and helping to resurrect the brand in later years, honoring his mentor's legacy.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Mega Ramp Pioneer (Late 1990s-2000s)</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Danny's most revolutionary contribution to skateboarding came with his pioneering of the Mega Ramp—a massive structure that would enable unprecedented heights and distances. This innovation wasn't just about building bigger ramps; it was about reimagining what was possible in skateboarding. The Mega Ramp opened up entirely new dimensions of progression in the sport.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    Through his work on the Mega Ramp, Danny set multiple world records, including the highest air achieved on a skateboard (23.5 feet) and executing a 360 over a 75-foot gap. These feats weren't just records—they were statements about the potential of human performance and the spirit of progression that drives skateboarding.
